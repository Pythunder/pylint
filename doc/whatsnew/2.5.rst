**************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.5
**************************

:Release: 2.5
:Date: TBC


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* A new check ``isinstance-second-argument-not-valid-type`` was added.

   This check is emitted whenever **pylint** finds a call to the `isinstance`
   function with a second argument that is not a type. Such code is likely
   unintended as it will cause a TypeError to be thrown at runtime error.

* A new check ``assert-on-string-literal`` was added.

   This check is emitted whenever **pylint** finds an assert statement
   with a string literal as its first argument. Such assert statements
   are probably unintended as they will always pass.

* A new check ``f-string-without-interpolation`` was added.

   This check is emitted whenever **pylint** detects the use of an
   f-string without having any interpolated values in it, which means
   that the f-string can be a normal string.

* Checks for invalid return types from protocol functions:

   * ``__bool__`` must return a bool
   * ``__index__`` must return an integer
   * ``__repr__`` must return a string
   * ``__str__`` must return a string
   * ``__bytes__`` must return bytes
   * ``__hash__`` must return a string
   * ``__length__hint__`` must return a non-negative integer
   * ``__format__`` must return a string
   * ``__getnewargs__`` must return a tuple
   * ``__getnewargs_ex__`` must return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)

Other Changes
=============

* Configuration can be read from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file in the current directory.
  A setup.cfg must prepend pylintrc section names with ``pylint.``, for example ``[pylint.MESSAGES CONTROL]``.
  A pyproject.toml file must prepend section names with ``tool.pylint.``, for example ``[tool.pylint.'MESSAGES CONTROL']``.
  These files can also be passed in on the command line.

* Add new ``good-names-rgx`` and ``bad-names-rgx`` to enable permitting or disallowing of names via regular expressions

  To enable better handling of whitelisting/blacklisting names, we added two new config options: good-names-rgxs: a comma-
  separated list of regexes, that if a name matches will be exempt of naming-checking. bad-names-rgxs: a comma-
  separated list of regexes, that if a name matches will be always marked as a blacklisted name.

* Mutable ``collections.*`` are now flagged as dangerous defaults.

* Add new ``--fail-under`` flag for setting the threshold for the score to fail overall tests. If the score is over the fail-under threshold, pylint will complete SystemExit with value 0 to indicate no errors.

* Added a new option ``notes-rgx`` to make fixme warnings more flexible. Now either ``notes`` or ``notes-rgx`` option can be used to detect fixme warnings.

* Non-ASCII characters are now allowed by ``invalid-name``.

* ``pylint`` no longer emits ``invalid-name`` for non-constants found at module level.

  Pylint was considering all module level variables as constants, which is not what PEP 8 is actually mandating.

* A new check ``non-ascii-name`` was added to detect identifiers with non-ASCII characters.

* Overloaded typing functions no longer trigger ``no-self-use``, ``unused-argument``, ``missing-docstring`` and similar checks
  that assumed that overloaded functions are normal functions.

* ``python -m pylint`` can no longer be made to import files from the local directory.

* Various false positives have been fixed which you can read more about in the Changelog files.
